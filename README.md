# INFO3406_Assignment1
Machine Learning on Cifar 10 and 100.
## Description
This is a quick readme file discussing the specifications for the assignment submitted.
Please take the time to read the submitted instructions on how to run the code.
## Requirements
- Python3
- all Anaconda libraries

## Running the code
#### CIFAR 10 
Cifar10 code is excuted by "python cifar10.py".
At the beginning you will receive a prompt asking do you want to use your own test images. If you are putting images in INFO3406_assignment1_query then type y and ENTER. Otherwise you will be using our test batches that have been provided.
The program will then run each testcase printing out what it thinks eventually finishing and returning results in a csv.

Note: I have setup the evaluation part as best as I could with only the vague details as guide.
Small adjustments may need to be made to the given code which works with the image in INFO folder.
